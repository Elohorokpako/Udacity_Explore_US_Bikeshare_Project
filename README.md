# Udacity_Explore_Bikeshare_Project
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote codes to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Description of Data
The dataset for the project were provided by [motivate](https://www.motivateco.com) ;a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
The raw dataset for this project can be accessed in the [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16N9oj65eJ382MdLJi0jZgMHCX-A7Uce1?usp=sharing)
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

## Statistics Computed
In this project, I wrote codes to provide the following information about the datasets
* Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration
* User info

The result from the analysis is presented in [bikeshare_project]()

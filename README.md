# Udacity_Explore_Bikeshare_Project
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote codes to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Description of Data
The dataset for the project were provided by [motivate](https://www.motivateco.com);a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
The raw dataset for this project can be accessed in the [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16N9oj65eJ382MdLJi0jZgMHCX-A7Uce1?usp=sharing)
